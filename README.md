# Apriori_Algorithm
Implementation of Apriori Algorithm in C++. 
This implementation takes a set of transactions as input, where each transaction is represented as a vector of integers. The minimum support threshold is also provided. The apriori function implements the Apriori algorithm and returns a list of frequent itemsets. The main function provides an example usage of the algorithm with some sample transactions and a minimum support value of 0.2. The frequent itemsets are then printed to the console.
